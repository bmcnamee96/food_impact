# The Impact of Food on the Environment

### Using PostgreSQL a data analysis project was created looking at the environmental impact that different foods have on the environment. Data was taken from 'Our World in Data' as a CSV file and imported into PostgreSQL. Tableau was used to make easy to understand graphics using the SQL database.

## The Data
### The data included two separate tables (food_name and food_data). food_name includes the id, name, and the year that the data came from.  All of the data comes from 2022. food_data includes the id, emissions, land use, eutrophication, water scarcity, water withdrawals, and biodiversity.
