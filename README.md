# The Impact of Food on the Environment

### Using PostgreSQL a data analysis project was created looking at the environmental impact that different foods have on the environment. Data was taken from 'Our World in Data' as a CSV file and imported into PostgreSQL. Tableau was used to make easy to understand graphics using the SQL database.

## The Data
### The data included two separate tables (food_name and food_data). 
- food_name includes the id, name, and the year that the data came from.  All of the data comes from 2022. 
- food_data includes the id, emissions, land use, eutrophication, water scarcity, water withdrawals, and biodiversity.

## Analysis
### Emissions
- Beef is the largest emittor of emissons per kilogram of food.  There are 6 different categories that beef was in and all have a large impact on the emissions. This can be seen in Tableau emissions chart, that shows four different types of beef at the top. Overall, the beef emissions totals 369.2 per kilogram.
- Meat in general has a huge impact on emissions.

### Land Use

### Eutrophication

### Water Scarcity

### Water Withdrawals

### Biodiversity Impacts
